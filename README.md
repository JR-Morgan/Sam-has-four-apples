# Sam has four apples

This is a text-based game where the player must fight against an ever-changing syntax

This was a fun little project created in only a few days.

[Downloaded the Build here](https://github.com/JR-Morgan/Sam-has-four-apples/releases/latest).

## Gameplay

The game starts by displaying the following text

```
Sam has 4 apples, He eats 2,
How many apples does he have?
```

The user would then enter 2

A new round will begin, except with a mutation. E.g.
```
Sam is now apple
```

The next round will then read as follows

```
Apple has 3 Sams, he eats 1,
How many apples does he have?
```

As Mutations stack and stack, the game's difficulty becomes increasingly higher.
